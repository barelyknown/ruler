This code extends the Float class to enable pretty formatting of floats into approximate ruler measurements through the to_ruler method.

It automatically formats feet, inches, and fractions of an inch. The fractions are reduced using the largest common denominator with a maximum of 32nds of an inch.

Here are some examples:

this_number = 14.25
puts this_number.to_ruler
1' 2 1/4"

that_number = 1
puts that_number.to_f.to_ruler
1"

the_other_number = 142.37
puts the_other_number.to_ruler
11' 10 3/8"
